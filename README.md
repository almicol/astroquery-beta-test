_The test focuses specifically on recent developments related to the transition from the WDB backend to the TAP backend._ - [DFS-19635](https://jira.eso.org/browse/DFS-19635)

As a beta tester, we would like to ask your feedback on the following aspects:

 - What absolutely needs to be fixed before the release
 - What would be nice to be fixed before the release
 - Feature ideas and improvements for subsequent releases

The current astroquery ESO module documentation will mostly work: https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eso/eso.html

For the parts that unevitably needed changes, the updated documentation is found in the `docs` folder in this repository:
 - `./docs/AstroqueryEsoDocumentation-Beta.pdf`
 - `./docs/AstroqueryEsoDocstrings-Beta.pdf`
 - `./docs/html/`

## What to do?

1. Please copy the notebook `beta-test.ipynb` to `beta-test-<your name>.ipynb`
2. Run the notebook, experiment with it, and modify it as you wish, it is yours.
4. Give us your feedback via your preferred communication method.
If you want, you can open a Pull Request with your own modified notebook and your comments within it.

Thanks a lot for your participation, happy testing! :)
